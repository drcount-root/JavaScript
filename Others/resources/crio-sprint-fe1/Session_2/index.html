      The war was going badly for the French on all fronts and money and
      enthusiasm for the war was running out. Sumption describes the French
      administration as "fall[ing] apart in jealous acrimony and recrimination".
      The new pope, Innocent VI, a relative of John's,[21] encouraged
      negotiations for a permanent peace treaty and discussions opened at Guînes
      in early March 1353 overseen by the Cardinal Guy of Boulogne.[22] The
      modern historian George Cuttino states that Innocent was acting at John's
      instigation.[23] The English sent a senior deputation: Henry of Lancaster,
      one of Edward's most trusted and experienced military lieutenants; Michael
      Northburgh, keeper of the privy seal; William Bateman the Bishop of
      Norwich, the most experienced diplomat in England; and Simon Islip, an
      ex-keeper of the privy seal and the archbishop of Canterbury; among
      others. The French were represented by Pierre de La Forêt [fr], Archbishop
      of Rouen and John's Chancellor; Charles of Spain, who was the Constable of
      France and a close confident of John; Robert de Lorris [fr], John's
      Chamberlain; Guillaume Bertrand, the Bishop of Beauvais; and several other
      high-ranking figures. Both parties were ill-prepared and ill-briefed[24]
      with only two of the French delegation having any previous negotiating
      experience with the English.[25] After several meetings it was agreed they
      would adjourn to receive further instructions from their monarchs,
      reconvening on 19 May. Until then hostilities would be suspended by a
      formal truce. This temporary agreement was signed and sealed on 10
      March.[24] In early May 1353 the English requested the negotiations not be
      restarted until June, to allow them to discuss the matter more fully. The
      French responded on 8 May by canceling the truce and announcing an
      arrière-ban for Normandy, a formal call to arms for all able-bodied males.
      The negotiators met briefly in Paris on 26 July and extended the truce
      until November, although all concerned understood that much fighting would
      continue. [26] French central and local government collapsed. French
      nobles took to violently settling old scores rather than fighting the
      English. Charles of Navarre, one of the most powerful figures in France,
      broke into the bedroom of Charles of Spain and murdered him as he knelt
      naked, pleading for his life. Navarre then boasted of it and made
      tentative approaches to the English regarding an alliance.[27][28] Navarre
      and John formally reconciled in March 1354 and a new balance within the
      French government was reached; this was more in favour of peace with
      England, in some quarters at almost any price. Informal talks started
      again at Guînes in mid-March. The principle whereby Edward abandoned his
      claim to the French throne in exchange for French territory was agreed;
      Edward gave his assent to this on 30 March. Formal negotiations
      recommenced in early April. The French were represented by Forêt, Lorris
      and Bertrand again, joined by Robert le Coq, Bishop of Laon, Robert, Count
      of Roucy, and Jean [fr], Count of Châtillon.[29] The makeup of the English
      delegation is not known.[30] Discussions were rapidly concluded. A formal
      truce for a year was agreed, as was the broad outline of a permanent
      peace.[31] On 6 April 1354 these heads of terms were formally signed by
      the representatives of both countries,[32] witnessed by Guy of
      Boulogne.[29] The war was going badly for the French on all fronts and
      money and enthusiasm for the war was running out. Sumption describes the
