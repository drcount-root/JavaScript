// Effect of hoisting on function declaration

// Func declarations are hoisted or not? => Yes, they're hoisted.

// Initial value => Actual function

// Scope => Only in 'use strict' mode they are block scoped. And in 'sloppy mode' the func declarations are function scoped

// 'use strict' came with ES5
